<p style= "font-size:25px;"> Cricket is my favorite sport. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field. The game of cricket is said to have originated in the 16th century in South East England. It instantly became popular among the people of England. England named it as its national sport in the 18th century.</p>

<p> 1)Test Cricket: This is the traditional form of the game, played over five days with each team having two innings. It is known for its strategic depth and is often considered the pinnacle of cricket.
</p>

<br>

<p> 2)One Day Internationals (ODIs): Each team plays 50 overs, and the match is completed in a single day. This format balances the traditional and the modern approach to the game.
</p>

<br>

<p>
3)Twenty20 (T20): This is a relatively new and fast-paced format where each team plays 20 overs. T20 games are known for their high scoring and explosive batting, making them highly entertaining.
